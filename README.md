### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Open `topic_modeling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the notebook to preprocess the data, train the LDA model, and generate topic visualizations.

## File Description

- `topic_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `data`: Data used in this project is kaggle news category dataset.

## Results
